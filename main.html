                <h1>Earning the Federal Minimum Wage Is Worth 17% Less Now</h1>
                <h2>Inflation is soaring, and the minimum wage has stayed at $7.25 since 2009</h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks to inflation, U.S. workers earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour have seen the
                    value of that pay rate decline by about 17% since 2009 (the last time the federal minimum wage was
                    raised), according to The Balance’s analysis of data from the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S.
                    Census Bureau.

                    Our analysis looked at the minimum-wage workforce, the total number of workers in the U.S. making
                    the minimum wage for the state in which they work. Because the federal minimum wage has not
                    increased since 2009 and some states have their own minimum wage rate, only workers in states with a
                    minimum wage of $8.75 or higher as of 2021 have seen their wages keep pace with inflation.1 Workers
                    who are still earning just $7.25 per hour, or even just slightly more, have less buying power now
                    than they did in 2009. In other words, if you’re making $7.25 an hour, your paycheck is worth less
                    now than it was 13 years ago.

                    “Not only has the federal minimum wage been stagnant for a dozen years, but inflation has become
                    another whammy,” said Ben Zipperer, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. “Minimum wage
                    workers are effectively earning less and less because their wages don’t go as far to buy the things
                    they need to live.

                    <h3>Costs Have Increased, But the Federal Minimum Wage Has Not</h3>
                    <p>
                        The federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour has been the same since 2009. Because wages have
                        remained
                        stagnant, workers effectively earn less and have less buying power now than they did 13 years
                        ago.
                        For example, the average sales price of a home in the U.S. was $272,900 at the end of 2009. At
                        the
                        end of 2021, the average sales price for a home was $497,300.2 So while housing prices—and the
                        costs
                        of many other goods and services—have increased over the last 13 years, the federal minimum wage
                        has
                        not, and that makes it less and less of a livable wage.
                        According to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the federal
                        poverty level for a family of four is $27,750 in 2022, which equals about $13.34 per hour—a full
                        $6.09 above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 and clearly still far too low for someone to make
                        a
                        living and provide a decent standard of living for a family.3 And even if the federal minimum
                        wage
                        had kept pace with inflation between 1968 (when it was $1.60) and 2021, it would still have only
                        been about $12.46 per hour in 2021, according to our analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor
                        Statistics—still below the federal poverty level for a family of four in 2022.

                    <h3>Some States Have Taken Action To Increase the Minimum Wage</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is some good news, thanks to states raising their own minimum wages: The proportion of
                        U.S.
                        workers earning $7.25 per hour has decreased to an estimated 13% in 2021. That’s because a
                        number of
                        states with large minimum-wage workforces have raised the bar on what they pay those
                        minimum-wage
                        workers.</p>

            <div id="scrolling-text">

                    <p>
                        For example, Washington, D.C., New York, and Colorado increased their hourly minimum wages the
                        most
                        since 2009 to $15.20, $12.50, and $12.32, respectively.4 These increases have kept pace with
                        inflation better than other states that still have the minimum wage at or close to the federal
                        minimum of $7.25. Even a state like Ohio, which did increase its minimum wage from $7.30 to
                        $8.80 by
                        2021, made strides in the right direction, but not enough for its wage to keep up with
                        inflation.

                    <h3>The Minimum Wage Has Changed Drastically By State</h3>
                    <p>
                        When adjusted for inflation, minimum wages in states still pegged to the federal minimum have
                        lost value since 2009. Most states that have raised their minimum wage (with the exception of
                        Ohio) have increased the value of that wage for workers by at least 0.03%

                    <p>“There’s a game of catch-up happening, as states and cities are moving to raise their wages, but
                        it’s revealing to see just how far workers are falling behind because of the federal minimum
                        wage,” said Molly Kinder, a fellow at Brookings Metro, a research arm of the Brookings
                        Institution that focuses on worker pay and power.

                        This is causing an imbalance across the U.S.—minimum wage means different things in different
                        states now. While many states have increased their minimum wage significantly over the last
                        decade, 20 states still use the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour as their own.

                        Five states—South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, and Louisiana—have no minimum wage
                        law at all, and Georgia and Wyoming have minimum wages below the federal baseline ($5.15 an
                        hour).4 In these states, most minimum-wage workers are covered under the Fair Labor Standards
                        Act, which enforces the federal minimum.5

                    <h3>West Coast and Northeast States Require Higher Minimum Wages Than Those in the South</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Balance’s analysis found that more workers on the West Coast and in the Northeast are paid
                        higher minimum wages than those workers in most Southern and interior states. The Northeast
                        states of New Hampshire and Pennsylvania are exceptions, as workers in both states make $7.25 an
                        hour. Washington, D.C., currently has the highest minimum wage in the nation, at $15.20 per
                        hour, which is more than double the federal minimum wage.4

                <div>
                    <p>There are several states, including Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, that have
                        a large number of workers still only earning the federal minimum wage. Texas has nearly 430,000
                        workers who earn $7.25 per hour, or less, as of 2021. If Texas had the same minimum wage as
                        Arkansas (which pays $11 per hour), each of its minimum-wage workers would earn an average of
                        about $7,800 more each year (before taxes, based on working 40 hours per week).

                        The federal minimum wage is not enough for U.S. workers to live, especially with the way prices
                        have increased over the last few years. The annual inflation rate was 8.5% in March and while
                        the Federal Reserve is working to tame it by raising interest rates, there’s no guarantee that
                        prices won’t continue to increase for the next several months.6</p>

                        There is a bit of hope, though: President Joe Biden raised the minimum wage for federal
                        employees to $15 per hour in January 2022. That $15-per-hour rate could be something all
                        minimum-wage workers see in the future if the Raise the Wage Act of 2021 passes; it currently
                        awaits review by Congress.7

                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <p>

                    The Balance gathered data on minimum wage by state from 1990 to 2021 via the U.S. Department of
                    Labor (DOL). If a state had a range for its minimum wage in a given year, the highest wage in the
                    range was used for all workers. All inflation adjustments to 2021 dollars were made from annual
                    values that match DOL data via the IPUMS CPI adjustment. The adjustment from the last minimum wage
                    change to the current year was done with 2010 and 2021 annual average values.

                    The estimated number of individuals making their state’s minimum wage for each year since 1990 was
                    calculated from Annual Social and Economic Supplements to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current
                    Population Survey microdata via IPUMS. Based on conversations between The Balance and IPUMS staff,
                    the minimum-wage workforce in each state for a given year was calculated by including the
                    individuals who reported an hourly wage (via the PAIDHOUR ASEC variable in IPUMS) at or below that
                    state’s minimum wage for a given year, and individuals whose weekly wages (via the EARNWEEK ASEC
                    variable in IPUMS) when divided by their usual weekly hours worked (via the UHRSWORKT ASEC variable
                    in IPUMS, replaced by either UHRSWORK1 or AHRSWORKT when respondent’s weekly working hours varied)
                    came out equal to or less than their state’s minimum hourly wage for a given year.
